## For Your Local Windows Environment

### Quick Fix Steps:

   ```powershell
   # In your project directory
   git fetch origin
   git checkout cursor/fix-missing-import-for-depends-8fea
   git pull origin cursor/fix-missing-import-for-depends-8fea
   ```

2. **Verify the Import Locally**
   Open: `cpsc-regulation-system\backend\app\admin\routes.py`
   
   Check line 5 contains:
   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status, BackgroundTasks, Request
   ```

3. **Restart Your Server**
   ```powershell
   cd cpsc-regulation-system\backend
   py run.py
   ```

### Alternative: If Pull Doesn't Work

If you're still seeing the error after pulling, manually verify/add the import:

**File:** `cpsc-regulation-system\backend\app\admin\routes.py`

**Line 5 should be:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status, BackgroundTasks, Request
```

Make sure `Depends` is included in the import list!
