# ⚡ ACTION REQUIRED - Server Restart Needed

## 🎯 **What You Need to Do NOW**

Your server is currently **running old code** and has an **outdated database schema**. Both issues need to be fixed.

---

## 🔧 **The Fix (3 Simple Steps)**

### **Step 1: Stop the Current Server** ⏹️
```powershell
# In the terminal where server is running:
Press CTRL+C
```

Wait for it to fully stop.

---

### **Step 2: Reset the Database** 🗑️

The old database is missing new columns. Reset it:

```powershell
python reset_database.py
```

When prompted, type: **yes**

**What this does:**
- Deletes old `cfr_data.db` file
- Clears data directories
- Allows fresh database with new schema

---

### **Step 3: Restart the Server** 🚀

```powershell
python main.py
```

**Important:**
- First run will download **FLAN-T5-base** (~900MB)
- This takes **30-60 seconds**
- Subsequent runs will be instant

---

## ✅ **What Will Be Fixed**

### Fixed Error 1: Database Schema
```
❌ Before: sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: sections.section_label
✅ After: Database has all new columns
```

### Fixed Error 2: Missing Method
```
❌ Before: AttributeError: 'DataPipeline' object has no attribute 'get_status'
✅ After: All new methods loaded
```

### New Features Working:
- ✅ Real-time pipeline progress bar
- ✅ FLAN-T5-base LLM (high quality)
- ✅ Content-based cluster summaries
- ✅ Auto-display stats on completion

## ⏱️ **Timeline**

```
Step 1: Stop server           → 5 seconds
Step 2: Reset database        → 10 seconds
Step 3: Restart + download    → 60 seconds (first time)
                               → 10 seconds (after)
Total: ~75 seconds first time, ~25 seconds after
```

## 🚨 **Common Issues**

### Issue: "reset_database.py not found"
```powershell
# You might need to create it:
# The script is in your directory
# Or just delete manually:
Remove-Item cfr_data.db
```

### Issue: "Server won't stop"
```powershell
# Force stop:
CTRL+C (might need to press twice)
# Then restart
```

### Issue: "Download is slow"
```
# This is normal for first time
# FLAN-T5-base is ~900MB
# Be patient, only happens once
# Model is cached after download
```

---

## ✅ **Verification After Restart**

### Check 1: Server Starts
```
✅ Should see: "LLM model (FLAN-T5-base) loaded on cpu"
✅ Should NOT see errors
```

### Check 2: UI Loads
```
✅ http://localhost:8000/ui opens
✅ No console errors
```

### Check 3: Pipeline Works
```
✅ Enter URL → Run Pipeline
✅ Progress bar appears
✅ Updates: 0% → 17% → 33% → ...
✅ Stats display when done
```

### Check 4: Clustering Quality
```
✅ Summaries are detailed (>40 words)
✅ Mention specific requirements
✅ Names are meaningful
```

## 📋 **Complete Command Sequence**

**Just copy and run these:**

```powershell
# Stop server
