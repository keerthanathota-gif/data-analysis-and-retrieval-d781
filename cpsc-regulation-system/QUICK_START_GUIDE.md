# CPSC Regulation System - Quick Start Guide

## 🎉 Issues Fixed!

Both issues have been resolved:

1. ✅ **Login now works** - Authentication database initialized with default admin user
2. ✅ **Page fits screen** - Responsive design improvements prevent scrolling

---

## 🚀 How to Start the System

### Option 1: Using the Start Script (Recommended)

```bash
cd /workspace/cpsc-regulation-system
./start.sh
```

This will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Initialize the database (if needed)
- Start both backend and frontend servers

### Option 2: Manual Start

**Backend:**
```bash
cd /workspace/cpsc-regulation-system/backend
python3 init_db.py  # Only needed first time
python3 run.py
```

**Frontend (in a new terminal):**
```bash
cd /workspace/cpsc-regulation-system/frontend
npm install  # Only needed first time
npm start
```

2. You'll be redirected to the login page
3. Use these credentials:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `admin123`
4. Click "Sign in to Dashboard →"

## 👥 Creating New Users

## 📱 Responsive Design

The login page now properly fits different screen sizes:

- **Desktop (>960px):** Full two-panel layout with features showcase
- **Tablet/Mobile (<960px):** Single panel, streamlined layout
- **Short screens (<800px):** Optimized padding and spacing

No more scrolling on standard screens! 🎊

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Was Fixed:

**1. Authentication Database**
- Created `backend/init_db.py` to initialize the auth database
- Database file: `backend/auth.db`
- Default admin user auto-created on first run

**2. Login Page CSS**
- Changed container height from `minHeight: '100vh'` to `height: '100vh'`
- Added responsive padding adjustments
- Added media queries for different screen sizes
- Enabled vertical scrolling only when necessary (very short screens)

### Files Modified:
- `backend/init_db.py` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/pages/AuthPage.js`
- `start.sh`

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If login still doesn't work:

1. **Check if database exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /workspace/cpsc-regulation-system/backend/auth.db
   ```

2. **Reinitialize database:**
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/cpsc-regulation-system/backend
   python3 init_db.py
   ```

3. **Check backend is running:**
   - Visit: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
   - You should see the API documentation

4. **Check frontend is running:**
   - Visit: http://localhost:3000
   - You should see the login page

### If page still scrolls:

1. **Clear browser cache:** Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. **Check screen resolution:** Very short screens (<700px height) may show minimal scrolling
3. **Zoom level:** Ensure browser zoom is at 100%

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any other issues:

1. Check the console logs in your browser (F12 > Console)
2. Check backend logs in the terminal
3. Verify all dependencies are installed:
   - Python 3.x
   - Node.js 14+
   - Required Python packages (installed via requirements.txt)
   - Required npm packages (installed via package.json)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

After logging in successfully:

1. **Change the default admin password** (security best practice)
2. **Create additional users** as needed
3. **Explore the dashboard** features
4. **Start using the CFR regulatory search** functionality

---

## 📝 Default Credentials (For Reference)

**Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin`

⚠️ **Important:** Change this password immediately after first login!
