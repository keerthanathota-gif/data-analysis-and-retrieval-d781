# ✅ Sign Out - Simple Working Version

## Implementation

Reverted to the simple, proven approach that works:

```javascript
const handleSignOut = () => {
  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to sign out?')) {
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    localStorage.removeItem('user');
    window.location.href = '/login';
  }
};
```

## How It Works ✅

1. **User clicks "Sign Out" button**
   - White button with ↗ arrow icon
   
2. **Confirmation dialog appears**
   - "Are you sure you want to sign out?"
   
3. **If user confirms:**
   - ✅ Removes 'token' from localStorage
   - ✅ Removes 'user' from localStorage
   - ✅ Redirects to `/login` page

## Benefits ✅

- **Simple**: No complex async operations
- **Reliable**: Direct localStorage clearing
- **Works**: Same approach as previous logout
- **Clean**: Removes all auth data
- **Secure**: Full page reload ensures clean state
