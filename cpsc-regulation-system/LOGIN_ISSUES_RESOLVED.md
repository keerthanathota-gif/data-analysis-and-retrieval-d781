# ✅ Login and Responsive Design Issues - RESOLVED

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Tested

---

## 🎯 Summary

Both issues you reported have been successfully fixed:

### Issue #1: Unable to Login ✅ FIXED
**Root Cause:** The authentication database (`auth.db`) did not exist, so there were no users to authenticate against.

**Solution:** 
- Created database initialization script
- Auto-initialized database with default admin user
- Updated startup script to check and initialize database automatically

### Issue #2: Login Page Scrolling ✅ FIXED
**Root Cause:** CSS styling caused the page to overflow the viewport height.

**Solution:**
- Changed container from `minHeight: '100vh'` to `height: '100vh'`
- Added responsive padding for different screen sizes
- Implemented media queries for mobile and short screens
- Page now fits perfectly on screen without unwanted scrolling
