# Login and Responsive Design Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-10-26

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Users were unable to login because the authentication database (`auth.db`) did not exist.

**Solution**:
- Created `backend/init_db.py` script to initialize the authentication database
- Installed required dependencies (sqlalchemy, passlib, python-jose, bcrypt)
- Initialized the database with proper tables
- Created default admin user

**Default Credentials**:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**To create additional users**: Use the signup page at `/signup` or create them through the admin panel.

### 2. Login Page Scrolling Issue ✅
**Problem**: The login page was causing vertical scrolling instead of fitting the screen.

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed `GradientContainer` from `minHeight: '100vh'` to `height: '100vh'` to enforce exact viewport height
- Added `overflowY: 'auto'` to `LeftPanel` to allow scrolling only within the form container if needed
- Reduced padding on smaller screens with responsive media queries:
  - `@media (max-width: 960px)`: Reduced padding to 20px
  - `@media (max-height: 800px)`: Reduced vertical spacing for shorter screens
- Adjusted `StyledPaper` padding for different screen sizes
- Reduced `LogoBox` margin from 48px to 32px (24px on short screens)

## Files Modified

1. **backend/init_db.py** (NEW)
   - Database initialization script

2. **frontend/src/pages/AuthPage.js**
   - Fixed styled components for proper viewport fitting
   - Added responsive design improvements

## How to Use

### Starting the System

1. **Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd cpsc-regulation-system/backend
   python3 run.py
   ```

2. **Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd cpsc-regulation-system/frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Login
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Use credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Click "Sign in to Dashboard"

### Creating New Users
1. Click "Start your free trial" on the login page
2. Fill in the signup form
3. After signup, return to login page to sign in

## Testing Performed

✅ Database initialization successful
✅ Default admin user created
✅ Responsive design improvements applied
✅ Login page now fits viewport without scrolling on standard screens

## Notes

- The login page will show minimal scrolling on very short screens (< 700px height) but only within the form area
- OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, Apple) require additional configuration in environment variables
- Change the default admin password after first login for security

## Responsive Breakpoints

- Desktop: Full two-panel layout with features panel
- Tablet/Mobile (< 960px): Single panel layout, features hidden
- Short screens (< 800px): Reduced padding and margins
